## Overview
It is my first challenge in frontend mentor, I had alot of new information while searching to implement the unusual grid layout.
I think the main concept is to break the roles and think out of the box that the html structure element order doesn't always represent the required layout suiting different devices.
### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
